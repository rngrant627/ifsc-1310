  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a style or blueprint of web development that structures the workflow of development when creating a webpage. It's broken down into three different parts allowing for it to be understood easier and make the initial planning phases for a site simpler. The three parts of Progressive enhancement are html/content, css/presentation, and javascript
With these three parts you can focus on the content easier than how you would like to present that content on the site and finally small touches like javascript to make your site look more lively. The main goal of this development style is to allow for your website to be displayed properly on as many devices as possible while retaining its style and functionality.
</p>
<p>Progressive enhancement is important for modern web development because it essentially brakesdown the development side of web development and focuses on the content so it can be accessed from almost any device unlike developing with a mindset of graceful degradation which has subtle differences and focuses more on providing the best experience for only the best/relevant devices at the time which lead to the content, presentation and the scripting to eventually become dated by normal standards.

<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p>During my time of working on this project I learned a lot of things about web development and what it takes to create a functioning website. Starting off I would like to give some insight on what feedback I received from my friends/peers on my original project being the SpaceX Dragon webpage in which we were tasked with creating a website that informed the user about what the spacecraft was and so fourth. The first initial comets I received for feedback were that my site didnâ€™t load images properly and that it displayed the alt text for the image instead, so that was one of the first things I changed when I started working on the revised version of the site. Another issue I had with the project was the organization of my code which I actually managed to smooth out on both versions of my project. Finally the last issue I wanted to fix was the style of the website of my website, which several friends of mine pointed out that it was missing a cohesive design, originally the site lacked most of the css attached to it now and didn't feature a working header that allowed you to select the page you wanted to visit and it lacked the main logo for the header but now both iterations contain most of the changes I made to the revised project.
</p>
<p>Now reflecting over the semester I would like to say picked up on many new skills that I may use in the future. Things I feel like did well during the semester was gaining a deeper understanding of html and being able to grasp its more advanced concepts and use them throughout the assignments we were given to complete. On the other hand things I would do differently if I was able to start the class over would be to study css more due to me still having difficulty understanding it's more complicated aspects and being able to  properly use it in the future if I go down the path in life requires me to use it. Overall I greatly enjoyed the semester and had a lot of fun learning about web development and everything else that goes into it and I wouldn't mind learning more on the subject.
