  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a style or blueprint of web development that structures the workflow of development when creating a webpage. It's broken down into three different parts allowing for it to be understood easier and make the initial planning phases for a site simpler. The three parts of Progressive enhancement are html/content, css/presentation, and javascript
With these three parts you can focus on the content easier than how you would like to present that content on the site and finally small touches like javascript to make your site look more lively. The main goal of progressive enhancement is to allow for your website to be displayed properly on as many devices as possible. 
</p>
<p>Progressive enhancement is important for modern web development because it essentially brakesdown the development side of web development and focuses on the content so it can be accessed from almost any device unlike developing with a mindset of graceful degradation which has subtle differences and focuses more on providing the best experience for only the best/relevant devices at the time which lead to the content, presentation and the scripting to eventually become dated by normal standards.
